This python project simulates cars that have access to 3 distances: straight ahead, to the right and to the left :

Then we give these 3 inputs to a neural network, and at the output there are 2 binary output neurons:
1 0 : The car goes to the right
0 1 : Car goes left
00 or 11 : the car goes straight on

Then I use a genetic algorithm to optimize the weights of the neural network

In the simplest case, cars just have to turn left and go straight ahead :
